When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my code.
    When I want to have a back up that I can access from any computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might only want to pull changes when I've recently contributed to the project,
    or I might only want to pull changes after I've worked from a certain computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are a clone of a GitHub repository into another account. Changes
    made to the copy do not reflect on the forked (original) repository.
    
    Instead of cloning a GitHub repository to a local directory and then creating a
    remote repository and pushing to GitHub, I would just fork the GitHub
    repository. This is quicker.

    You can clone a remote repository to a local directory. You do this if
    you want to work on the code locally.

    A branch is a history of commits of a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    In case I lose the information on the remote or I have no Internet connection,
    then I can still do my work.
